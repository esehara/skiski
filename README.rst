SKISKI -- Learning assistant for SKI Combinator with Python
===========================================================

**skiski** derive from Japanese word "好き好き(skiski)". Then **skiski** Library is for peason who love SKI Combinator ;)

# Perpose

I know that SKI Combinator influenced some esoteric language, `Unlambda` and `Lazy K`.but, it is too hard to use these language, because of strict about SKI Combinator, or *Functional Language*.Then it is too hard to learn SKI Combinator.

I want to get *not purely SKI Combinator Library*, and decide DIY :).
